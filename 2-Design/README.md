# Design and Provision Infrastructure
Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.

You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.
Before deployment with Azure resources, development teams should:
1. [Understand the architecture and design concepts of Azure Machine Learning](1-MLOpsArchitectureConcepts.md).
2. [Learn about model management, deployment, lineage and monitoring with Azure Machine Learning](2-ModelManagement.md).
3. [Understand the technology choices available](3-AMLTechChoices.md).
4. [Understand the technology Selection criteria for edge deployment](4-EdgeDeployment.md).
5. [Understand the Enterprise security and governance for Azure Machine Learning](5-EnterpriseSecurity&Governance.md)
6. [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](6-Authentication.md)
7. [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](7-how-to-assign-roles.md)
